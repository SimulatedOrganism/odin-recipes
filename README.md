# odin-recipes

## description
This project builds a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
## skills demonstrated
Since this project is about building my HTML chops, some skill may be knowing when to use certain elements that carry a special meaning, known as semantic HTML. 
Semantic HTML elements include the <em> element which makes the text italic and gives it extra emphasis and the <strong> element which makes the text bold-faced and imparts more importance to it. 
Another skill may be using best practices such as using the noopener or noreferrer values for the rel HTML attribute of the <a> element to prevent phishing attacks such as tab nabbing.
This project will also involve a Git repository and keeping a revision history of the changes made to the files. An important skill to demonstrate is that of writing good commit messages which involves limiting the subject line to a recommended 50 characters, writing the reasons for making the changes, what they intend to do in place of any and all explanations of how the code itself changed. This also promotes atomic changes where a single change should have its own commit and makes it easier for other developers to read and understand changes.
This will also show how to use shortcuts such as tab completion, shortcuts on VSCode to fill out the boilerplate for a HTML5 document. 

The bigger picture skill is practicing the normal workflow of a Git repository and how to build a website including its file tree structure and how the home page links to other pages of the same website.

Even though using noopener and noreferrer protect from tab nabbing, I would think its less important when opening pages on the same website and even more so by the same publisher since if logged in that might affect cookies and user preferences for the same website.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="roman">
            <li><h3>First Dough Phase</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Proof the yeast by combining the water, sugar, and then yeast together in a mixing bowl. After five minutes, the mixture will have a foamy layer on top.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour, cornmeal, and sugar to the mixing bowl and mix it a little.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/4 cup of melted butter having a temperature no greater than 120°F to avoid killing the yeast. On low speed, mix the ingredients for about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove dough from bowl and form into ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with the olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it so that all sides.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours so the dough doubles in size.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Tomato sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>While the dough rises, prepare the tomato sauce.</li>
                    <li>Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium head and allow it to melt.</li>
                    <li>Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes so the onion slightly browns, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar, and turn the heat down to low-medium heat and allow sauce to simmer for about 30 minutes or until there is under 3 cups of sauce.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Toppings</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>While the dough continues to rise, prepare the toppings.</li>
                    <li>In another saucepan, add enough water to just cover the bottom, add sausage, and set over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Turn over sausage until it has evenly browned and transfer to plate.</li>
                    <li>In the same saucepan, add enough water to just cover the bottom, add bacon, and set over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Turn over bacon until it is evenly cooked and transfer to same plate.</li>
                    <li>Add olive oil in different pan and place over medium heat. Add mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Saute mushrooms for 5 minutes until lightly browned.</li>
                    <li>Lower heat to low-medium, simmer for another 5 to 8 minutes until tender.</li>
                    <li>Set aside cooked mushrooms along with sausage and bacon.</li>
                    <li>Seed the bell pepper and slice it and the onion, removing the skin and ends of the onion.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Second Dough Phase</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lightly flour work surface. Remove dough from bowl, saving bowl and aluminum foil for later, and punch down dough to remove air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough into a large 15-inch by 12-inch rectangle.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of dough.</li>
                    <li>Roll it up lengthwise so the dough is still 12 inches in one dimension and cut in half to form 6-inch long logs.</li>
                    <li>Form each log into a ball and place back into greased bowl, covering with the saved aluminum foil and allow to rise in refrigerator.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assembly and Bake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 425°F.</li>
                    <li>Keep one ball of dough in the refrigerator while working with the other.</li>
                    <li>Roll one ball of dough on lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle.</li>
                    <li>With the rolling pin over the circle, fold over a portion of the dough over it, and guide the dough over the 9-inch by 2-inch deep dish cake pan.</li>
                    <li>Press the dough into the cake pan so it is tight fitting inside the cake pan. Trim any excess that hangs off the edges.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the second ball of dough.</li>
                    <li>Fill each pizza with 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, then the toppings, followed by half the sauce, and finally sprinkle 1/2 the Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Place both cake pans on a baking sheet and bake for 20-28 minutes or until crust is golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
